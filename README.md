Using Tekkit Classic 3.1.2 (MC 1.2.5) RedPower + ComputerCraft to make a functional Elevator. 
Hello. If you have came across this, chances are you know me. And how dumb I am given that. 

But anyways, in case you DON'T... this is a project where I create a elevator/lift in Minecraft 1.2.5 using RedPower and ComputerCraft

The reasons of using a old version is mainly because the original mod developer lost interest, and the re-creations of the RedPower mod wasn't the best in the late versions. 

Keep in mind if you want to run this code, it's highly undocumented, and not easily re-configurable. I shall put a World download which is more convinient sometime in the future.

In the meantime, feel free totally to bug me about how slow this project is and I would be amazed if I even made any changes than adding this very line. 

Update: The elevator now actually functions to a decent amount. I am happy as is really. Big achievement for me, however, obviously, this is not the end.

More advanced scheduling can be added with even directions. 

For the World Download: Please use Tekkit Classic 3.12. And in case you are not near the creation, please teleport to -406, 64, 252
