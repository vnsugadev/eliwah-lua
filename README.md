Using Tekkit Classic 3.1.2 (MC 1.2.5) RedPower + ComputerCraft to make a functional Elevator. 
Hello. If you have came across this, chances are you know me. And how dumb I am given that. 

But anyways, in case you DON'T... this is a project where I create a elevator/lift in Minecraft 1.2.5 using RedPower and ComputerCraft

The reasons of using a old version is mainly because the original mod developer lost interest, and the re-creations of the RedPower mod wasn't the best in the late versions. 

Keep in mind if you want to run this code, it's highly undocumented, and not at all re-configurable depending on how you set it up. I shall put a World download which is more convinient sometime in the future.
